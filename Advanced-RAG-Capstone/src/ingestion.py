"""
Step 1 of the pipeline: load documents from disk and tidy them up.

This module answers one question: "how do I turn a PDF, TXT or DOCX file on my
computer into clean LangChain `Document` objects with useful metadata?"

A LangChain Document is just two things:
    document.page_content -> the text
    document.metadata     -> a dictionary of extra information we attach
We rely on that metadata later to show the user where an answer came from.
